[wallabag is an open source application](https://wallabag.org) to **save your web articles and allows you to read them later**, on your smartphone, your tablet or your ereader. We propose to you a quality service to host your account: you'll get the latest version of the application and **you'll get a professional support**.

wallabag was founded in 2013 by Nicolas Lœuillet, a french web developer. Because it can be difficult to install and maintain wallabag, Nicolas created in 2016 **wallabag.it**, this online service to allow you to archive the web.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-server" title="Hosted in Europe" %}}
Because your data belongs to you, we don't want to store them on US servers. That's why we only chose European partners, like Hetzner (german web hoster). We also prefer host ourselves our tools, like PHPList (mailing list software).
