  A great tutorial to read wallabag articles on your Kobo e-reader

Jan Ouwens was a user of Pocket. Now he is a satisfied customer of **wallabag.it**.

> wallabag is a FOSS tool that you can self-host, or you can use their instance for a small fee. I chose the latter, because I’m lazy, I like supporting small FOSS developers, and everything is hosted safely in Europe.

He shared a tutorial on his blog: [« Reading blogs on my Kobo e-reader via wallabag »](https://jqno.nl/post/2025/06/04/reading-blogs-on-my-kobo-ereader-via-wallabag/).

I hope this great article will help you ... and maybe [it will help us to have a native Kobo integration](https://piaille.fr/@nicosomb/114591105271561144).
