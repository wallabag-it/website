I started wallabag 4 years ago. It was a personal project. Today, this application — to save web articles and read them later on your computer, your smartphone, your tablet or even your ereader — is used by hundreds of people.

Quickly, wallabag took me more and more time. I decided to try to work officially for this project. That’s why wallabag.it was born.

For few euros per year (€12), you have an account with all the wallabag features. No need to install the application, no need to configure it: all is done for you.

If you want to try our service, no credit card information is required: you’ll get a 14-day free trial. You can try it, export your data and leave our service at any time.

> Your privacy is important

Unlike other services you know, our business model is simple: it’s only based on your subscriptions. We don’t need to read and sell your data. An other example that we respect your privacy: on app.wallabit.it, we don’t track you.

> 250.000

Today, you are above 250 users and you saved 250.000 articles. In less than three weeks.

As I explained in this (french) post, the first days were stressful: many users with thousand of articles to import. Our web architecture wasn’t so tuned to handle that. But today, all seems to be ok.

**Stay tuned …**

We opened this blog to give you news about our service. You can also follow us on twitter or Facebook. And stay tuned, because we may have some gifts for Christmas for our clients. More news in coming days!
