## With Pocket shutting down, what's next for read-it-later fans?

For years, Pocket has been a service for saving articles to read later—clean interface, multi-device syncing, and offline access. So when Mozilla announced it was discontinuing Pocket, it sent many readers scrambling for an alternative.

If you're wondering where to go next, you're not alone. Let's explore the best options—and why **wallabag.it** might be your best choice.

## Some alternatives

Several services have been present in the “read-it-later” ecosystem for many years:

- Instapaper offers a clean reading experience with highlights, notes, and text-to-speech. However, its best features are locked behind an expensive subscription.
- Raindrop.io is more of a visual bookmarking tool than a pure reading app. It does have a reader view, but its focus leans heavily toward organizing links and websites.
- Pinboard is a minimalist bookmarking service with a loyal following. It's stable and reliable—but lacks any kind of reading interface or offline features.

These tools all have their strengths, but if you're looking for something that mirrors Pocket's mission—and maybe goes even further—there's one name that stands out.

## Here is wallabag.it

wallabag.it is the hosted version of wallabag, an open-source read-it-later app. It was built with a simple idea in mind: **your reading list should belong to you**.

Here's why it's an excellent alternative:

### ✅ Full article storage

Unlike some tools that only save a link or partial content, wallabag retrieves the full text of the page—cleaned up and ad-free. Even if the original website disappears, your copy stays intact.

### ✅ Privacy by design

wallabag doesn't track you, sell your data, or clutter your reading with ads. It's open source, and wallabag.it is run by people who believe in user freedom, not exploitation.

### ✅ Hosted in Europe

All data on wallabag.it is stored on servers located in Europe, under the protection of strict EU privacy laws and GDPR compliance. A big reassurance for anyone wary of US based data handling practices.

### ✅ Offline reading

Sync your saved articles across devices—including phones, tablets, and even e-readers like Kobo—and enjoy them offline.

### ✅ Tagging, annotations, and search

Organize your articles with tags, take notes, and quickly find past reads with full-text search.

### ✅ Easy migration from Pocket

[Moving from Pocket is simple](https://wallabag-it.zammad.com/help/en-gb/2-import/6-how-to-migrate-from-pocket-to-wallabag-it): wallabag.it provides a straightforward import tool that preserves your articles and metadata.

## Pricing comparison

Here's how wallabag.it compares with other popular services in terms of cost:

| Service         | Yearly cost                                       | Notes                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **wallabag.it** | **11€/year**                                      | All features included, privacy-focused, open source         |
| Instapaper      | 55€/year                                          | Includes full-text search, unlimited notes, text-to-speech  |
| Raindrop.io     | 26€/year                                          | Adds full-text search, annotations, reminders, and backups  |
| Pinboard        | 22€/year                                          | Minimal bookmarking tool, no reader mode, no offline access |

➡️ **wallabag.it clearly offers the best value**: it provides a full-featured, distraction-free reading experience for just 11€/year, with no ads or upsells. You can also support development more generously with the 30€/year supporter plan, or try it for 4€ over 3 months.

## Final thoughts

Pocket's shutdown is a chance to rethink where your data lives and what kind of tools you want to support. If you're looking for a modern, respectful, open, and sustainable read-it-later service, wallabag.it is more than just a replacement—it's an upgrade.

**wallabag.it is powerful, private, hosted in Europe and affordable.**

So if you're still asking, _“Which Pocket alternative should I choose?”_ — your next stop might just be **wallabag.it**.
