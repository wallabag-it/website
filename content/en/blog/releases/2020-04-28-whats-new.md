Hello!

Some news for the last week on wallabag.it.

## Save articles by email

Due to a bug (which is now fixed), we resetted the IMAP setting. You need to create a new token. Sorry for this issue ðŸ˜¢

## Invoices

On the subscription page, you can now retrieve all your invoices.

## Tags edition is fixed

When you edited a tag from the tags list, the tag was deleted ðŸ˜± This bug is now fixed.

## Please confirm before mass deleting

If you want to delete articles with mass actions, there is now a confirmation before deleting all your articles ðŸ˜…

That's all for this week. Have a nice day, take care of yourself!

Nicolas
