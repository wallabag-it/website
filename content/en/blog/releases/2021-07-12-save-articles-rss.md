It was a long overdue feature: you can now have RSS or ATOM feeds directly into your wallabag account. Each hour, this feed is updated (or you can update it manually).

If you want to save an article from your favorite feed, you need to click on the save icon and that's all.

For the time being, this feature is opened to users who have a 25â‚¬ subscription. It's a beta-test phase. But in few days, it will be opened for all wallabag.it customers.

I still need to work on some part of this feature (delete a feed, documentation, etc.) but it works ðŸŽ‰ You just to need to click on the Feeds item in the left menu and create a new feed.

If you have any issue, send me an email at nicolas@wallabag.it.
