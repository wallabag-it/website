Hello!

Some news for the last week on wallabag.it.

## Dark side of wallabag

wallabag has finally a dark mode. You can enable it by clicking on the account icon.

## Bugs fixed

This new version fixes a lot of bugs (you can see the changelog here)

## Import tags from Pocket

When you imported data from Pocket, the tags weren't fetched. It's now fixed.

## Invoices

I changed my billing tool. Now I use a self hosted and opensource application (Invoice Ninja). Some changes for you: for example, when you receive your invoice, you can now have a dashboard with your old invoices.

## A financial summary for wallabag.it (in french, sorry)

I wrote a blog post on my personnal blog about the 4 years of wallabag.it. You can read it here: https://nicolas.loeuillet.org/billets/quatre-annees-de-wallabag-it

It's now the time to me to wish an happy end of year. Take care of you.

Nicolas (nicolas@wallabag.it)
