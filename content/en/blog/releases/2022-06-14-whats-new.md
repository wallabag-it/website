Almost a year since my last email. But wallabag is still alive and active.

I just upgraded wallabag.it platform and here is the changelog:

- the baggy theme has been deprecated and will be removed in next version (only the material theme will remain).
- Delicious import (if you still have credentials for your account, just go https://del.icio.us/)
- You can now list entries with annotations https://app.wallabag.it/annotated/list
- You can now add a tag to a search results
- A new API endpoint was added to retrieve the user configuration

See you soon. Have a nice day!

Nicolas
