## History of wallabag.it

wallabag is a self hostable application for saving web pages: save and classify articles. Read them later. Freely.

For those who donâ€™t want or canâ€™t host wallabag by themselves, we launched wallabag.it on December 2016. wallabag.it is the quality service that you need to host wallabag. You have a quality hosting, a professional support, automatic upgrades and daily backups.

There are several subscriptions:

- 9â‚¬ per year
- 3â‚¬ for 3 months
- 25â‚¬ per year if you really love wallabag ðŸ¦˜ and if you can pay this amount.

wallabag.it is almost 7 years old.
Since the beginning, we have not changed the pricing.

But our web hoster increased its prices at the beginning of the year. Thatâ€™s why we decided to update ours.

## Our new pricing

In coming weeks, the new pricing will be :

- 11â‚¬ per year (less than one coffee per month!)
- 4â‚¬ for 3 months
- 30â‚¬ per year if you really love wallabag ðŸ¦˜ and if you can pay this amount.

## What about our competitors?

### Pocket

### Pinboard

## Next?

We work regularly on wallabag.it platform.

In coming days, weâ€™ll update the instance, by adding new features:

- Mass action to add tags to articles
- A new setting to show / hide articles thumbnails (useful for slow connections)
- Add Stripe support to pay your subscription

## Maintenance on Saturday 22, July

Our great sysadmin have to upgrade our servers. Thatâ€™s why wallabag.it will be closed on Saturday 22, July. It should be a quick intervention (few hours).

Have a great day!
